# --- concurrency diagnostics ---------------------------------------
#
# Nearly every endpoint in this file is a sync `def`, which Starlette
# runs on anyio's worker threadpool rather than the event loop. That
# pool defaults to 40 threads and nothing here raises it, so a 41st
# concurrent request waits for a thread instead of being served.
#
# Measured on a synthetic app with the same shape (sync endpoints,
# default limiter): a latency-sensitive endpoint answers in 1-2 ms with
# 39 slow requests in flight, 273 ms at 45, 951 ms at 60 and 1951 ms at
# 100. It is a cliff, not a slope — nothing at all until the pool is
# full, then queue-depth times however long the blocking calls take.
#
# What was never established is whether Tideway reaches 40 in normal
# use. That matters because it is the leading explanation for four
# separate reports — UI lag, "Fetch is aborted", covers not rendering,
# and pause feeling unresponsive — and nobody has confirmed or killed
# it. Rather than manufacture load to find out, this records what real
# sessions actually do, so a user who hits the lag can read the answer
# off /api/diagnostics/concurrency afterwards.

    override when the underlying data changes slowly enough that a
    longer cache is worthwhile (e.g. the resolved chart, whose cold
    load takes ~18 s).

    `persistent=True` adds a SQLite-backed second layer at

    lifetime.

    "no Tidal resolved" failures for the full 1-hour TTL — every
