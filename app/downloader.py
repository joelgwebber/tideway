          URL. One entry in the returned list, no extension or codec hint.
        * PKCE sessions can't call get_url (tidalapi raises URLNotAvailable

          manifest (MPEG-DASH or BTS) whose `urls` is a list of segment
          URLs. For DASH hi-res content that list may have dozens of
          short segments which we concatenate into one FLAC file. The
          manifest also carries a file_extension hint and a codec name.

        The codec is the source of truth for what's actually inside the
        bytes — tidalapi's file_extension hint looks at the URL string
        and labels DASH FLAC segments as `.m4a` (because the segments
        are fragmented MP4 containers). The downloader uses the codec
        to override that hint when needed and remux to native FLAC.
