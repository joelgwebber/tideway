"""UPnP / DLNA MediaRenderer output.

DLNA's `MediaRenderer` profile is the universal target for "play
this audio on a network device" across every consumer streamer
that doesn't speak Tidal Connect natively: WiiM, most Bluesound,
Cambridge, Yamaha, Denon AVRs, NAD streamers, LG / Samsung TVs,
and a long tail of cheaper Hi-Fi network bridges. This module
ships a sender for that protocol so those devices appear in the
Sound Output picker alongside Cast.

## Architecture

Mirrors `app/audio/cast.py` very deliberately. The streaming half
is identical: Tideway encodes PCM to FLAC into a ring buffer, an
embedded HTTP server serves the buffer at a LAN-reachable URL, the
device pulls from that URL. The control half differs: Cast issues
`MediaController.play_media`, DLNA issues UPnP/SOAP
`AVTransport.SetAVTransportURI` + `Play`. Both put the device in a
"pull our stream" state and we just keep encoding.

  audio callback                                                   │
                                                                   ▼
  Renderer ◀──HTTP GET stream────  StreamHTTPServer  ◀───reads── RingBuffer
       ▲
       │ SetAVTransportURI(stream_url) + Play
       │
  AVTransportController (SOAP over HTTP)

## Why a separate manager from `tidal_connect.py`

That module targets OpenHome-flavoured devices (Linn, some Naim,
some Bluesound) and assumes the device fetches audio directly from
Tidal with its own paired session. The device is the audio source.
DLNA is the opposite: Tideway is the audio source, the device is
just an output. The discovery filters, control plane, audio
plumbing, and silencer behaviour all differ. Trying to merge the
two managers produced a flag-soup that obscured both paths;
keeping them separate keeps each one's invariants legible.

## Why this won't accidentally surface OpenHome-only devices

`_filter_dlna_renderer` rejects devices that don't expose
AVTransport. A Linn DSM (OpenHome-only) doesn't show up here; it
only shows up in `tidal_connect.py`'s discovery. A WiiM (DLNA-only)
shows up here and not there. Devices that expose both (some
Bluesound) appear in both lists. The picker lets the user choose
how they'd rather drive it.

# SSDP discovery uses our own sockets rather than async-upnp-client's
# async_search(). Two real-world interop constraints shape the design,
# and they pull in opposite directions -- which is why we use TWO
# sockets (see _collect_ssdp_locations):
#
#   1. Spec-compliant renderers reply via unicast to the M-SEARCH
#      SOURCE port, so the active search must own a port nothing else
#      contends for: we bind it to an EPHEMERAL port. Binding the search
#      to :1900 (which we used to do, mirroring gssdp-discover) silently
#      broke discovery whenever another SSDP app -- Spotify, the Sonos
#      app, any DLNA controller -- already held :1900. SO_REUSEPORT lets
#      the bind succeed by sharing the port, and the kernel then hands
#      each inbound UNICAST reply to only ONE of the sharing sockets, so
#      the other app swallowed our renderer's answers and the picker
#      stayed empty.
#
#   2. Some renderers -- notably USB Audio Player PRO and other
#      Android-based devices -- always reply to port 1900 of the
#      requester regardless of the M-SEARCH source port, and others only
#      announce via unsolicited multicast NOTIFY. So we ALSO keep a
#      best-effort passive :1900 listener. Both of those are multicast
#      or reply-to-1900 traffic, which a shared :1900 tolerates fine

#      off the fragile unicast search path. See GitHub #234 and #220.
