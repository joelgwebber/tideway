"""Tests for `app.aoty_resolver.resolve_listing`.

The resolver's behavior matters more than its implementation: callers
hand it a chart listing and expect every entry back, each decorated
with a Tidal album dict or `None`. The cases worth pinning are the
defensive paths (no listing, missing artist/title, search exception,
serializer exception) and the cache contract (hit short-circuits the
fan-out, miss writes through, None is never persisted).

The fan-out itself uses a ThreadPoolExecutor of 3 workers per the
rate-limit posture comment in the module — testing that requires real
threads. Each test stubs the search / serializer / sleep with simple
fakes, so the threading is incidental.
