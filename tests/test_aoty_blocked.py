"""Tests for the Cloudflare-challenge detection path in `app.aoty`.

We pin two things here:

  1. A 403/503 response carrying `cf-mitigated: challenge` flips
     `is_scraper_blocked()` to True so the Home page can render
     its "report on GitHub" notice.
  2. A plain non-200 response (real HTTP error, not a CF
     challenge) does NOT flip the flag — the notice should only
     fire on the specific failure mode that needs a code change.
